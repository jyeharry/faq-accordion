## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [PostCSS Utopia](https://github.com/trys/postcss-utopia) - for fluid spacings
- [Vite](https://vite.dev/)

### What I learned

Not a whole lot learned in this challenge. I felt it was fairly simple. Although it was cool getting to use the native `<details>` and `<summary>` elements for the first time.
